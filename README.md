# 📖 Grant Finder

**AI-powered Grant Search & Discovery**  
Helping nonprofits *find*, *filter*, and *prioritize* grants faster so they can secure funding without sifting through endless portals.



## 🚀 Problem Statement
 
> How might non-profit organisations “pull” information about grants from the OurSG grants portal that are relevant to them according to key criteria including issue area, scope of grant, KPIs, funding quantum, application due date, etc., so that they can strengthen their financial sustainability?

**Grant Finder** addresses this by providing:

- **Fast, relevant grant discovery**  
- **AI-driven filtering and matching**  
- **A streamlined process that saves time and effort**  

Powered by AI, it dramatically reduces the time spent on grant research — helping non-profit organisations focus on funding impact, not paperwork.

## 🔍 What This Does

Grant Finder helps you:

- Automatically discover grants that match your criteria  
- Pull structured grant information from OurSG grants portal
- Prioritize opportunities by relevance and urgency
- Save hours compared to manual search processes

AI-driven grant discovery tools like this can scan large datasets and return tailored opportunities in seconds rather than hours or days, making it a game-changer for nonprofits.


## 📦 Features

✨ **AI-Powered Filtering & Deep Analysis** Grant Finder uses Gemini AI to perform **deep-dive scraping** from the OurSG portal and afterwards ranks grants based on your nonprofit’s mission, focus area, and project parameters.
- **Beyond the Summary:** The system identifies external links (e.g., "Find out more") and scrapes those destination pages and documents to capture the full scope of the grant.
- **Comprehensive Intelligence:** By analyzing this deep-level data—including detailed KPIs and specific funding clauses, we provide fully informed grant ecommendations.

🎯 **Precision Grant Matching** We don't just search keywords. Our AI analyzes scraped data which includes important criterias including **Issue Area**, **Grant Scope**, **KPIs**, **Funding Quantum**, and **Due Dates** so that:
- **Relevance is guaranteed:** You only see grants where your mission aligns with the funder's issue area.
- **Eligibility is checked:** We filter out grants where the funding quantum or scope doesn't match your project.
- **Deadlines are prioritized:** Expired or unfeasible application dates are automatically deprioritized.

🚦 **Informative Grant Results** Each recommendation provides:
- **Grant Name & Abbreviation** (clickable link to full details and application page)  
- **Reasoning** explaining why this grant is a good match
- **Funding Amount and eligibility details**
- **Application Deadlines**

🚀 **Streamlined Grant Discovery** Skip hours of manual searching — the platform presents tailored grant recommendations quickly, helping nonprofits focus on planning and impact rather than paperwork.

📊 **Database is Updated Regularly** Our system performs scheduled scrapes of the OurSG portal to ensure the data you view is updated.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Grant Finder makes discovering the right grants simple and intelligent:
